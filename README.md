# A Go boilerplate
Hi there, here is a Go boilerplate and i also added docker-compose to run as local with Docker.

## Required
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to running this project.
- MongoDB client ([Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/), [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) or what ever you want to use) to access database.
